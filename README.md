# TransciptMetaAnalyst

### A graphical user interface to meta-analyze RNA-Seq transcriptomics data

This app is designed to help biologists with less programming skills to perform meta-analysis of several transcriptomic RNA-Seq-generated data sets in order to get robust results and new insights into the data that was generated by their own studies or the data available online.
