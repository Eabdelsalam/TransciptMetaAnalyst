# TransciptMetaAnalyst

### A graphical user interface to meta-analyze RNA-Seq and/or microarray transcriptomics data

This app is designed to help biologists with less programming skills to perform meta-analysis of several transcriptomic (either RNA-Seq- or microarray- generated datasets in order to get robust results and new insights into the data that was generated by their own studies or the data available online.
